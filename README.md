# <ins>The bookStoreDB_project</ins>


Our goal was to build a relational database that stores information about the bookstore's operations, including ***books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, and more.*** We were tasked to create a database that efficiently stores all necessary data and allows for quick retrieval and analysis. This was our step-by-step approach to achieving this:

**1.** We effectively created an Entity Relation diagram using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)  in order to display the relationships between every table in the bookStoreDB_project database. every column that is in the tables, and primary and foreign keys established.

**2.** We created a DATABASE for the bookstore, established the SQL commands for creating the table schemas and datatypes that matched the data structure created in the entity relation diagram for all the tables in the bookStoreDB_project database(books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, etc.)

**3.** We applied security practices to control access to the database by setting up user groups and roles. We achieved this tools such as CREATE USER, and GRANT. We granted the administrators with all privileges on the bookstore database and granted the users with the ability to SELECT only in the database.

## **<ins>Outcome</ins>:** 🚀💡
- Designing and implementing a MYSQL database for a real-world case.
- Creating tables with the optimal schema and data types for the database.
- Managing database access through user groups and roles to ensure security. 🛡️
- Managing to query the data and exact meaningful information.
